## ⚛️ React Fundamentals Used

This project was built using key React concepts, including:

- 🧩 **Components & Props** – Reusable UI blocks for modular design.  
- 🔁 **State Management (`useState`)** – To handle dynamic data like cart and wishlist.  
- ⚙️ **Side Effects (`useEffect`)** – To load data and sync local storage.  
- 🧭 **React Router (`useLoaderData`, `useNavigate`)** – For routing and navigation.  
- 🎛️ **Conditional Rendering** – To toggle between tabs and display content dynamically.  
- 🖱️ **Event Handling** – To manage user interactions such as add/remove from cart.  
- 🧠 **Helmet (`react-helmet-async`)** – For dynamic SEO titles and meta tags.

## 💾 Data Handling & Management

- 💿 **Local Storage:** Used for storing cart, wishlist, and order history data persistently.  
- ⚡ **Loader Function (React Router):** Loads product data efficiently.  
- 🧰 **Utility Functions:** Custom helper methods in `/utility/AddToDb.js` for managing stored data.
